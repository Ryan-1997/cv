        <p>Currently studing <em><b>Computer Science</b></em> at <strong><a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/">The University of Salford</a></strong></p>
        <p>I am currently in my second year of this course, after already completing a Foundation year and First year, in which I was taught the fundamentals of programming with languages such as
          Python, Java, C# and HTML. I was alsointroduced to CSS styling, in which I am now spending my free time outside of university to use the skils I already have to build fully functioning websites which not only perform as expected but which
          also look the part.
          My plan is to graduate from this course with the best results I can possibly gain from studying hard, so that I can then either land my dream job, or
          start my own web development business.</p>
